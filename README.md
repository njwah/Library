# Library

This is part of an excercise for the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Javascript Pathway.

This is my solution for the assignment to implement a Library option to Add books to a card item with DOM manipulation.

## Assignment

1. Set up your project with skeleton HTML/CSS and JS files.
2. All of your book objects are going to be stored in a simple array, so add a function to the script (not the constructor) that can take user's input and store the new book objects into an array.
3. Write a function that loops through the array and displays each book on the page.
4. Add a "NEW BOOK" button that brings up a form allowing users to input the details for the new book: author, title, number of pages, whether it's been read and anything else you might want.
5. Add a button on each book’s display to remove the book from the library.
6. Add a button on each book’s display to change its read status
