This is part of an excercise for the ([Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)) Javascript Pathway.

This is my solution for the assignment.

## Assignment

- Set up your project with skeleton HTML/CSS and JS files.
- All of your book objects are going to be stored in a simple array, so add a function to the script (not the constructor) that can take user's input and store the new book objects into an array.
- Write a function that loops through the array and displays each book on the page.
- Add a "NEW BOOK" button that brings up a form allowing users to input the details for the new book: author, title, number of pages, whether it's been read and anything else you might want.
